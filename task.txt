TASK 2
Issue: Entry point (offset 0x18) pointed to hacked function (0x8048464) instead of _start (0x08048350), causing improper initialization
Solution: Used hexeditplus to change entry point from 0x8048464 to 0x8048350, fixing program startup sequence

./deep_thought 

readelf -h deep_thought | grep "Entry"

//   Entry point address:               0x8048464 -> it's not _start

readelf -s deep_thought | grep _start

// 61: 08048350     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 _start

TASK 3

Issue: main function contained malicious/offensive code
Solution: Calculated main's file offset (0x41d) and replaced first byte with ret instruction (0xc3), neutralizing the function

# Show what it does originally
./offensive                              # Does something offensive

# Find main
readelf -s offensive | grep " main"      # Address: 0x0804841d, Size: 23
readelf -S offensive | grep .text        # Calculate offset: 0x41d

# Hack it (neutralize main)

TASK 4
Issue: count_digits function had a bug counting digits incorrectly
Solution: Wrote correct count_digits in task4.c, compiled it, then used hexeditplus to copy the correct function (62 bytes from offset 0x11cd) over the buggy one (at offset 0x47d in ntsc)

# Show the bug
./ntsc 0123456789                        # Wrong output!

# Already have corrected version compiled
ls task4                                 # Your fixed version

# Find offsets
readelf -s task4 | grep count_digits     # 0x11cd, size 62
readelf -s ntsc | grep count_digits      # offset 0x47d

# Patch it
